# cats-api

Here is a very simple jest set up for tesing the FAVORITES endpoint on the 'thecatapi' website.

## Install and run

1. Navigate the website: https://github.com/country-bumpkin-software/cats-api and click the green button "Code"
2. Click 'copy to clipboard' icon for the HTTPS url
3. In your terminal find a good location - maybe Documents type ```git clone ``` and paste the contents of the clipboard to the terminal and press enter 
4. Once the remote repository is downloaded to your computer run: ```npm install```
5. Create a .env file in the root of the project and paste the api key I provided to you (in a seperate email) into that file and save it
6. run the command: ```npm run test```

The test runner should run the 4 tests that were outlined in the task.

I trust everything went smoothly!
